Hi everyone!

I am Xavier Nishikawa, a college student at Olin College of Engineering making a website to show the random (and hopefully cool) stuff I do. 

I created this website using React, Next, shadcn, tailwind, firebase and deployed using vercel. 

I am currently looking for an internship, so please help me!
